# Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah

I replicate the decompositions of output into permanent and transitory shocks in [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf). I replicate their quantitative results, and find that Blanchard and Quah, 1998 likely over-estimate the unemployment that results from positive supply disturbances but under-estimate the long-run effect on GNP growth of positive supply disturbances. Moreover, by evaluating Bayesian information criteria for a variety of lag-lengths, I find  evidence that Blanchard and Quah might have over-fit their their vector autoregressive (VAR) models.

## Repo Overview

In [Replication.m](https://github.com/Besiroglu/Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah/blob/main/Replication.m) I replicate the decompositions of output into permanent and transitory shocks in [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf).
