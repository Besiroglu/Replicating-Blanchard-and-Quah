# Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah

I replicate the decompositions of output into permanent and transitory shocks in [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf). I replicate their quantitative results, and find that Blanchard and Quah, 1998 likely over-estimate the unemployment that results from positive supply disturbances but under-estimate the long-run effect on GNP growth of positive supply disturbances. Moreover, by evaluating Bayesian information criteria for a variety of lag-lengths, I find  evidence that Blanchard and Quah might have over-fit their their vector autoregressive (VAR) models.

## Repo Overview

In [Replication.m](https://github.com/Besiroglu/Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah/blob/main/Replication.m) I replicate the decompositions of output into permanent and transitory shocks in [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf). Along with Blanchard and Quah, we assume that demand-shocks have no long-run effect on output, and impose this long-run restriction through a Cholesky Decomposition. [Replication.m](https://github.com/Besiroglu/Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah/blob/main/Replication.m) graphs the asccoiated impulse response response functions for a unit supply and demand disturbances estimated using the base-case  VAR(8)  model (figure reproduced below). Shaded  regions  represent  95%  confidence  interval  generated  by  bootstrapping  with 1,000 replications.

In [Model-selection.m](https://github.com/Besiroglu/Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah/blob/main/Model-selection.m), I compute the Bayesian Information Criteria for VARs with different lag-lengths. I consider lags ranging from 2 (as is suggested by theBayesian information criteria) to 8 (as is adopted in Blanchard and Quah, 1988) and the intermediate numberof lags, spaced out by 2 lags. I compute this for VARs that span the 1950-1988 period (considered in [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf)), and the 1950-2015 period. Moreover, I perform the Engle test for residual heteroscedasticity and the Ljung-Box Q-test for residual autocorrelation.

In [Robustness.m](https://github.com/Besiroglu/Replicating-Blanchard-and-Quah/blob/main/Robustness.m), I compute the median impulse response functions of 1000 such functions generated by bootstrapping for various VAR(p) models. Each model includes a time trend, and a break in GNP growth rate at 1973 Q4 (following [Blanchard and Quah, 1988](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf)). These are graphed (reproduced below)â€”the left panels present models estimated with data from the 1950-1988 period, and the right panels present models estimated with data from the1950-2015 period.
